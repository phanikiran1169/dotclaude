Conduct an in-depth technical interview using the AskUserQuestionTool to create a comprehensive specification. Ask non-obvious questions covering: system requirements, technical architecture, implementation approach, algorithms and data structures, hardware/software integration (if applicable), control systems, sensors/actuators (if applicable), safety and reliability, performance requirements, and critical tradeoffs.

Interview thoroughly until you fully understand the system, then write the specification. Use the provided spec file if given, otherwise create a new file in .claude/spec/ with appropriate naming.
